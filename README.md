# ProTrack - Full-Stack Job & Internship Portal

ProTrack is a comprehensive, role-based web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It serves as a bridge between students seeking opportunities and recruiters looking for talent, all managed under an admin's supervision.

### How to Run This Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` root.
    * Add your MongoDB Connection String as `MONGO_URI`.
    * Add a secret key for JWT as `JWT_SECRET`.
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Setup Frontend:**

### üöÄ Deployment Guide

To deploy a MERN stack app, we need to deploy the frontend and backend separately.

#### Part 1: Deploying the Backend to Render

Render is an excellent free service for hosting Node.js servers.

1.  **Push to GitHub:** Ensure your entire project (with both `backend` and `job-portal` folders) is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Create a Render Account:** Go to [Render.com](https://render.com/) and sign up using your GitHub account.
3.  **Create a New Web Service:**
    * On your Render dashboard, click "New +" and select "Web Service".
    * Connect your GitHub repository.
4.  **Configuration Settings:**
    * **Name:** Give your service a name (e.g., `protrack-backend`).
    * **Root Directory:** `backend` (This tells Render where your server code is).
    * **Runtime:** `Node`.
    * **Build Command:** `npm install`.
    * **Start Command:** `node server.js`.
5.  **Add Environment Variables:**
    * In the "Environment" tab, click "Add Environment Variable".
    * Add your `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` from your local `.env` file.
6.  **Deploy:** Click "Create Web Service". Render will build and deploy your backend. After deployment, Render will provide a public URL. Your backend URL is: `https://pro-track-job-portal-backend.onrender.com`.

#### Part 2: Deploying the Frontend to Vercel

1.  **Update API URL:**
    * In your frontend code, replace all instances of `fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/...')` with your live backend URL from Render.
    * **Example:** `fetch('https://pro-track-job-portal-backend.onrender.com/api/...')`
    * Apply this change in all relevant files (`Login-Register.jsx`, `RecruiterDashboard.jsx`, etc.).
2.  **Push Code to GitHub:** Commit and push this change.
3.  **Import to Vercel:**
    * Log in to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) with your GitHub account.
    * Click "Add New... -> Project" and import your repository.
4.  **Configure Project:**
    * **Framework Preset:** Vercel should automatically detect `Vite`.
    * **Root Directory:** `job-portal` (This tells Vercel that your React app is inside this folder).
5.  **Deploy:** Click the "Deploy" button. Vercel will build and deploy your frontend.

After following these steps, your application will be live on Vercel and will communicate with your backend hosted on Render.
